# Data Structures
Some misc. data structures I've found useful in my adventures.

One of the larger ones, a hashmap implementation, is contained in a separate repository, at http://github.com/Mause/dict.c, but it is also used by the set implementation used in this repo, so is sub-moduled at lib/dict.c.
